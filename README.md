## Building

Currently, it only works on macOS Catalina. 
I'll check how to make it work on other platforms
CMake can be used to build this plugin.
Follow the instructions in the following link if you don't have one on your machine.

https://cmake.org/install/

You need [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) to be installed on your machine to make it run.
On macOS, you can easily install it using homebrew.

```
brew install fftw
```

Here are the build commands for the plugin.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tmtakashi/3d-guitar-amp-renderer
cd 3d-guitar-amp-renderer
cmake -Bbuild .
cmake --build ./build --config Release --target 3DGuitarAmpRenderer_VST3
```
