The proposal sheet of the project can be found in this repository (since it is left as we submitted to the competition organizer, some implementation details are updated).

## Building

Currently, it only works on macOS Catalina and Mojave. 
I'll check how to make it work on other platforms.
CMake is required to build this plugin.
Follow the instructions in the following link if you don't have one on your machine.

https://cmake.org/install/

Here are the build commands for the plugin.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tmtakashi/3d-guitar-amp-renderer
cd 3d-guitar-amp-renderer
cmake -Bbuild .
cmake --build ./build --config Release --target 3DGuitarAmpRenderer_VST3
```

If you have trouble running the plugin, try

```
cmake --build ./build --config Debug --target 3DGuitarAmpRenderer_VST3
```

## Usage

1. Launch your VST3 compatible DAW (we've only tested with REAPER and Cubase AI), and insert `3DGuitarAmpRenderer` to your track. Set the project sample rate to 48,000Hz to match the BRIR wav files.
Make sure to configure the track to stereo.
2. Select `brirs/listening_room_brirs` or `brirs/tajigen_hall_brirs` from the file selector.
3. Get [GyrOSC](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gyrosc/id418751595) on your iPhone, and set the `Target IP Address`.
You can check the adress from Preferences > Network on your Mac. Set the port to 9001. Make sure your Mac and iPhone are connected to the same WiFi.
4. Mount the phone on your headphones, and connect your guitar to your audio interface. You can have better guitar playing experience by plugging in a pre-amp simulator before the plugin. 
5. Have fun!

Feel free to open an issue if you have any problem using the plugin!

## Todos

- Remove zipper noise by crossfading between impulse responses.
